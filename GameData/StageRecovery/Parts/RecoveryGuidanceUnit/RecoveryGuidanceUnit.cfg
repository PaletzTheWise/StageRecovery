	description = It's a nice weekend and you were invited to a barbecue but you can't go because you have to sit in mission control room and guide reusable launch vehicle stages to recovery. Not anymore, STEADLER got your back! This recovery guidance unit needs to record flight parameters of just one successful Kerbal-guided recovery and then it can take over control on subsequent recoveries. Of course we'll need you to enter recovery value in the unit for cor... accounting. Yes, accounting needs it, it's not important for correct function of the unit at all! But please make sure you enter the recovery value correctly, you don't want Kerbal Revenue Service to freeze your assets. DISCLAIMER: Barbecue invitation not included.
